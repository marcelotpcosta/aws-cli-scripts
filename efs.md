# Run the following AWS CLI command to list EC2 instances that are using a specific EFS file system. Replace your-efs-id with the ID of the EFS file system you want to check:

aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id your-efs-id

# Note the "OwnerId" of the EFS file system you are interested in.
# Next, list all of your EC2 instances using the following AWS CLI command:

aws ec2 describe-instances

# Examine the output to find EC2 instances associated with the EFS file system. Look for instances that have the EFS file system ID in their "Tags" or any other identifying information.

# Another way to check EFS usage is by examining the mount targets. Each EFS file system can have one or more mount targets associated with it. You can list the mount targets for an EFS file system and see which EC2 instances are using those mount targets.

# Use the AWS CLI to list the mount targets for the EFS file system:

aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id your-efs-id

# This command will give you a list of all the mount targets for the EFS file system.
